{"id":"northstar-ahq","title":"Add edit transaction functionality","description":"## Summary\nAdd ability to edit transactions from expense/income cards and detail sheet.\n\n## Context\n- TransactionForm already supports edit mode via `transaction`/`income` props\n- Server actions `updateExpense` and `updateIncome` already exist\n- `getTransactionWithEntries(transactionId)` fetches transaction + entries\n\n## Key Behavior\nWhen editing expense with installments: ALL entries are deleted and regenerated, losing `paidAt` status.\n**Decision**: Show warning dialog before editing multi-installment expenses.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. Create EditTransactionDialog component\nNew file: `components/edit-transaction-dialog.tsx`\n- Handles fetching transaction with entries (for expenses)\n- Renders TransactionForm in edit mode\n- Shows warning for multi-installment expenses\n\n### 2. Update ExpenseCard\n- Add `accounts: Account[]` prop\n- Add \"Edit\" menu item to dropdown\n- Integrate EditTransactionDialog\n\n### 3. Update IncomeCard\n- Add `accounts: Account[]` prop\n- Add \"Edit\" menu item to dropdown\n- Integrate EditTransactionDialog\n\n### 4. Update TransactionDetailSheet\n- Add `accounts` and `categories` props\n- Make Edit button functional\n- Close sheet when opening edit dialog\n\n### 5. Update parent pages\nPass accounts prop to cards in:\n- `app/(app)/expenses/page.tsx`\n- `app/(app)/income/page.tsx`\n\n### 6. Add translations\nAdd keys to `messages/en.json` and `messages/pt-BR.json`:\n- `expenses.editTransaction`\n- `income.editTransaction`\n- Warning dialog text for multi-installment edits\n\n## Editable Fields\n**Expenses**: description, amount, category, account, purchaseDate, installments\n**Income**: description, amount, category, account, receivedDate\n\n## Files to Modify\n1. `components/edit-transaction-dialog.tsx` (new)\n2. `components/expense-card.tsx`\n3. `components/income-card.tsx`\n4. `components/transaction-detail-sheet.tsx`\n5. `app/(app)/expenses/page.tsx`\n6. `app/(app)/income/page.tsx`\n7. `messages/en.json`\n8. `messages/pt-BR.json`","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-03T06:44:47.98322-03:00","created_by":"caiodgallo","updated_at":"2026-01-03T06:53:54.658421-03:00","closed_at":"2026-01-03T06:53:54.658421-03:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
