{"id":"northstar-110","title":"Fix: FAB modal shows 'Saving...' instead of optimistic UI","description":"## Problem\nThe FAB (Floating Action Button) and BottomTabBar modals show \"Saving...\" and wait for server response when creating expenses/income. They don't use optimistic UI like the list pages do.\n\n## Root Cause\nReact Context flows DOWN the component tree, not UP. Architecture issue:\n\n```\nLayout (app/(app)/layout.tsx)\n├── SidebarInset\n│   └── {children}  ← ExpenseListProvider/IncomeListProvider live HERE (page level)\n├── FAB (lines 38-43)\n│   └── TransactionForm  ← OUTSIDE providers, context = null\n└── BottomTabBar (lines 46-50)\n    └── TransactionForm  ← OUTSIDE providers, context = null\n```\n\n## What Happens\n1. User clicks FAB → opens TransactionForm\n2. `useExpenseContextOptional()` returns `null` (not inside provider)\n3. Falls back to: `await createExpense(data)` (line 137 in transaction-form.tsx)\n4. This IS blocking - modal waits for server\n5. \"Saving...\" persists until server completes\n\n## Solution: Fire-and-Forget in Form\nMake TransactionForm fire-and-forget when creating NEW items without context.\n\n**File: components/transaction-form.tsx**\n\nChange lines 136-138 from:\n```typescript\n} else {\n  await createExpense(data);  // BLOCKING\n}\n```\n\nTo:\n```typescript\n} else {\n  createExpense(data).catch(() =\u003e {\n    toast.error('Failed to create expense');\n  });\n}\n```\n\nSame for income (lines 165-167).\n\n## Files Involved\n- `components/transaction-form.tsx` - Form submission logic\n- `components/fab.tsx` - Desktop FAB (renders form outside context)\n- `components/bottom-tab-bar.tsx` - Mobile FAB (renders form outside context)\n- `lib/contexts/expense-context.tsx` - Optimistic context (works correctly)\n- `lib/contexts/income-context.tsx` - Optimistic context (works correctly)\n- `app/(app)/layout.tsx` - Where FAB/BottomTabBar mount\n- `app/(app)/expenses/page.tsx` - Where ExpenseListProvider lives\n- `app/(app)/income/page.tsx` - Where IncomeListProvider lives\n\n## Alternative Solutions\n1. Move providers to layout level (more complex, requires layout data fetching)\n2. Pass server actions as props to FAB (messy prop drilling)\n3. Use global state management (overkill for this)\n\nFire-and-forget in form is simplest - ~10 line change.\n\n## Testing Checklist\n- [ ] FAB from dashboard (no context) - closes immediately\n- [ ] FAB from expenses page (has context) - uses optimistic flow\n- [ ] Mobile bottom tab bar - closes immediately\n- [ ] Error toast shows on failure\n- [ ] Success case: data appears after revalidation\n- [ ] Edit mode still awaits (important!)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-04T07:28:53.698397-03:00","created_by":"caiodgallo","updated_at":"2026-01-05T07:07:06.337665-03:00","closed_at":"2026-01-05T07:07:06.337665-03:00","close_reason":"Fixed by removing FAB and moving transaction forms to page-level buttons inside provider context.
